# /projects — List Managed Projects

Show every project ApexStack is managing, with a one-line health snapshot. The behaviour depends on which mode you're in.

## Usage

```
/projects
/projects --status active
/projects --json
```

## Mode detection

ApexStack reads `onboarding.yaml` to decide:

```bash
grep -E '^\s*mode:\s*' onboarding.yaml 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `mode: single-project` (or missing — this is the default) | Show only the current repo |
| `mode: multi-project` | Read `apexstack.projects.yaml` and show every project listed |

## Single-project mode (the default)

In single-project mode, there's only one project — the repo Claude Code is running in. Output:

```
Project: {repo name from `git remote get-url origin`}
Branch:  {git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD}
Status:  active
Open PRs:    {gh pr list --state open --json number | jq length}
Open Issues: {gh issue list --state open --json number | jq length}
Last commit: {git log -1 --format='%h %ai %s'}
Uncommitted: {git status --porcelain | wc -l} files
```

If the user wants the full registry view, suggest:

```
You're in single-project mode. To manage multiple projects, set
`apexstack.mode: multi-project` in onboarding.yaml and create
apexstack.projects.yaml at the root.
```

## Multi-project mode

In multi-project mode, read `apexstack.projects.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1
projects:
  - name: example-app
    repo: your-org/example-app
    workspace: workspace/example-app
    docs: projects/example-app
    status: active
    roles: [tech-lead, backend-engineer]
```

For each project, gather:

```bash
# If a local workspace clone exists, use it for git data
if [ -d "{workspace}" ]; then
  BRANCH=$(git -C {workspace} rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
  LAST=$(git -C {workspace} log -1 --format='%h %ar %s')
  DIRTY=$(git -C {workspace} status --porcelain | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
else
  BRANCH="(not cloned)"
  LAST="-"
  DIRTY="-"
fi

# Always go to GitHub for PRs / issues (project of record)
PRS=$(gh -R {repo} pr list --state open --json number --jq 'length')
ISSUES=$(gh -R {repo} issue list --state open --json number --jq 'length')
```

## Output format (multi-project)

A markdown table:

```markdown
| Project | Status | Branch | PRs | Issues | Last Commit | Dirty |
|---------|--------|--------|-----|--------|-------------|-------|
| example-app | active | main | 3 | 12 | 2h ago — fix(...) | 0 |
| billing-api | handover | feature/GH-4 | 1 | 8 | 1d ago — feat(...) | 2 |
| marketing-site | paused | main | 0 | 1 | 30d ago — chore(...) | 0 |
```

After the table, a summary line:

```
3 projects · 4 open PRs · 21 open issues · 1 dirty workspace
```

And, if relevant, flag rows that need attention:

```
⚠ marketing-site: last commit 30 days ago (paused or stale?)
⚠ billing-api: 2 uncommitted files in workspace
```

## Filters

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--status active` | Only show projects with `status: active` |
| `--status handover` | Only show projects mid-handover |
| `--status paused` | Only show paused projects |
| `--status archived` | Only show archived projects |
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable JSON instead of a table |

## Errors and edge cases

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| Multi-project mode but no `apexstack.projects.yaml` | Print a clear error and a sample registry to copy |
| Project listed but workspace path missing | Show row with `(not cloned)` — don't fail |
| `gh` not authenticated | Show row with `?` for PRs/issues — don't fail |
| `repo` field looks invalid | Skip with a warning, continue with the rest |

## Rules

1. **Mode-aware** — single-project shows one row, multi-project shows N
2. **Source of truth for PRs/issues = GitHub** — never read from a stale local file
3. **Source of truth for branch state = local workspace** — `gh` doesn't know about your dirty files
4. **Don't silently fail on a missing project** — show the row, mark the gap
5. **Sort by status then name** — active first, then handover, then paused, then archived
6. **Never modify the registry from this skill** — read-only

## Related skills

- `/inbox` — same registry, but filtered to "needs your attention"
- `/status` — single-project deep dive (current branch, recent commits)
- `/tasks` — actionable list with URLs
- `/handover` — onboard a new repo into the registry
