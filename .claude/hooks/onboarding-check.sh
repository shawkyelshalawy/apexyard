APEXSTACK SETUP NOT RUN

This fork hasn't been configured yet. onboarding.yaml still has
placeholder values ("Your Company Name").

Run /setup to configure your fork in ~2 minutes:

  1. Describe your company and tech stack (one question)
  2. Review the proposed defaults
  3. Accept or customize

The config is committed to onboarding.yaml so it persists across
clones and team members — you only need to do this once per fork.
