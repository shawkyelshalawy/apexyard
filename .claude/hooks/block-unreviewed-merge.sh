# PreToolUse hook on `gh pr merge` AND `gh api .../pulls/<N>/merge`: blocks
# merging a PR that does not have BOTH required approval markers in place.
#
# Both merge shapes are covered — see _lib-extract-pr.sh for the parser and
# #47 for why the API-shape bypass was a gap worth closing.
#
# Enforces workflow-gates rule #5 ("2 reviews — agent + human, CI green,
# commit SHA matches review") at the merge boundary, mechanically. Two
# markers are required:
#
#   .claude/session/reviews/<pr>-rex.approved
#     Written by the code-reviewer agent (Rex) after a successful review.
#     Contents: the commit SHA Rex reviewed.
#
#   .claude/session/reviews/<pr>-ceo.approved
#     Written ONLY by the /approve-merge <pr> skill on explicit user
#     invocation. Contents: the commit SHA the CEO approved.
#
# Both markers must exist, and both SHAs must match the live HEAD. Any
# commits pushed after approval invalidate both — re-review and re-approve.
#
# The CEO marker is the mechanical enforcement of the "plan-level 'go' is
# NOT merge approval" rule in .claude/rules/pr-workflow.md. An umbrella
# "go" on a plan does not produce this file — only the /approve-merge
# skill does, and the skill is defined to run only on explicit user
# invocation that names the PR.
#
# Claude can technically forge either marker by running `touch` or `echo`
# directly. Doing so is a visible, auditable, grep-able rule violation
# and is itself a hard stop. The point of mechanical enforcement is to
# turn invisible inference failures into visible rule violations.

BLOCKED: PR #${PR_NUMBER} has no recorded code-reviewer (Rex) approval.

ApexYard requires two reviews before merge (workflow-gates rule #5):
  1. Code Reviewer agent (Rex) — automated, recorded in .claude/session/reviews/
  2. Human approver (CEO) — recorded by the /approve-merge skill

Missing file:
  ${REX_APPROVAL}

To unblock:
  1. Invoke the code-reviewer agent on this PR
  2. When Rex returns "approved", it records the approval automatically
  3. Then run /approve-merge ${PR_NUMBER} for the CEO approval
  4. Retry the merge

Never skip this check — even for typo fixes. See .claude/rules/pr-workflow.md.

BLOCKED: PR #${PR_NUMBER} has Rex approval but no CEO approval marker.

Plan-level "go" / "continue" / "ship it" does NOT authorize a merge. Each
merge requires an explicit per-PR, per-merge CEO approval that names the
PR. See .claude/rules/pr-workflow.md § "Plan-level 'go' is NOT merge
approval" for the full rationale.

Missing file:
  ${CEO_APPROVAL}

To unblock:
  1. Stop and ask the CEO explicitly: "PR #${PR_NUMBER} ready to merge — approved?"
  2. When the CEO says "approved" / "merge it" / "ship it" naming PR #${PR_NUMBER},
     invoke the /approve-merge skill:
       /approve-merge ${PR_NUMBER}
  3. The skill writes ${CEO_APPROVAL} with the current HEAD SHA
  4. Retry the merge

NEVER create this marker yourself from an umbrella "go" on a plan.
EVER. This is the exact failure this hook exists to prevent.
