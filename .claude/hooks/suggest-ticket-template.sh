NOTE: ApexYard has structured ticket templates. Consider using:

  /feature  — for user-facing features (includes user story + ACs)
  /bug      — for bug reports (includes Given/When/Then + repro steps)
  /task     — for tech debt, refactoring, CI, or non-user-facing work

These ensure every ticket has the right structure and labels.
If this is a quick operational issue (closing, commenting, labeling),
proceed with gh issue create as-is.
